```
```css

.mob-div {
    margin-top: 0;
    border: 1px solid white;
}

.empty {
    // border: 1px solid magenta;
    width: 300px;
    height: 10rem;
    position: relative;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;


    &__img {
        position: absolute;
        z-index: 1;
        top: 5%;
        left: 0;
        height: 300px;
    }
}

```
